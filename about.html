      <h4>About</h4>
      <p>
        The va'atele or traditional sailing double hulled canoe, "Gaualofa", was provided to the Aiga Folau o Samoa or Samoa Voyaging Society (SVS) by Okeanos Nature Film Productions (ONFP) in 2009, under a lease to purchase agreement. In June of 2012, Gaualofa was gifted to SVS and Samoa by Okeanos founder, Dieter Paulmann and his wife Hanna.

        The SVS is a Samoa-registered non-profit organization established in 2009.  The mission of the SVS is to firmly re-establish traditional voyaging as part of the Samoan cultural and national heritage.  SVS aims to engage the people of Samoa, especially the youth, to contribute to sustainable development and the preservation of the Samoan marine and land environment.

        SVS is developing public education programs incorporating values that were taught and learned throughout voyaging experiences during the 2011/2012 Te Mana o te Moana Pan-Pacific Voyage which spanned approximately 30,000 nautical miles.  The public education programs aim to promote positive Samoan cultural values, traditional navigation, respect for the ocean and nature, individual and social responsibility, discipline and integrity.

        In addition to education, SVS is also establishing a commercial component to provide funds for operating and maintaining Gaualofa for generations to come.  The commercial endeavors include environmentally friendly tourism opportunities which can be found on the Voyage With Us page. 
      </p>
      <p>
        SVS believes that by engaging in programs that promote ocean and land conservation, and traditional sailing and navigation skills, they can contribute positively to the growth and preservation of Samoan culture development and create leaders in environmental and cultural conservation.
