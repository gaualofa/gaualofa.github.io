      <p>
        The va’atele or traditional sailing double hulled canoe, “Gaualofa”, was provided to the Aiga Folau o Samoa or Samoa Voyaging Society (SVS) by Okeanos Nature Film Productions (ONFP) in 2009, under a lease to purchase agreement. In June of 2012, Gaualofa was gifted to SVS and Samoa by Okeanos founder, Dieter Paulmann and his wife Hanna.

        The SVS is a Samoa-registered non-profit organization established in 2009.  The mission of the SVS is to firmly re-establish traditional voyaging as part of the Samoan cultural and national heritage.  SVS aims to engage the people of Samoa, especially the youth, to contribute to sustainable development and the preservation of the Samoan marine and land environment.
