      <h4>Voyage With Us</h4>
      <p>
        SVS is developing public education programs incorporating values that were taught and learned throughout voyaging experiences during the 2011/2012 Te Mana o te Moana Pan-Pacific Voyage.  The public education programs aim to promote positive Samoan cultural values, traditional navigation, respect for the ocean and nature, individual and social responsibility, discipline and integrity.

      <p>
        In addition to education, SVS is also establishing a commercial component to provide funds for operating and maintaining Gaualofa for generations to come.  The commercial endeavors include environmentally friendly tourism opportunities such as whale-watching, transport to snorkeling and dive locations, site seeing tours and inter-island charters.
      </p>

        SVS believes that by engaging in programs that promote ocean and land conservation, and traditional sailing and navigation skills, they can contribute positively to the growth and preservation of Samoan culture development and create leaders in environmental and cultural conservation.
